# Welcome to Ken Mwangi's Portfolio

[![CI](https://github.com/kenmwangi/personal-portfolio/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kenmwangi/personal-portfolio/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Motivation

**Goal:** I wanted to have a digital garden to display what I am currently doing, documenting my full-stack journey and share knowledge others.

## How I started working on this project

The primary focus is to have a simple yet resourceful personal portfolio.

- I'a not a designer and as I build this I don't have one to provide a design so I found template from Figma community:
- Tasks were handled based on Clickup Board: file:///home/ken/Pictures/Screenshots/Kanban.png
- Bulding scalable Architecture was priority for this project (I plan to work on it for long, lol! üôàÔ∏è)
- I loved the idea of feature branches and Pull Requests. [Example](https://profy.dev/article/continuous-integration-with-github-actions)

## Choice of Technologies used?

- The choice for using Nextjs is based on it being _The React Framework
  for Production_. I was convinced.
- Typescript - I am life-long seeker of less buggy code. Easy to maintain and Refactoring will make me to code more. Convinced? Not yet? [Reason](https://ik.imagekit.io/87wct6jq4ql/tr:w-640/https://media.graphassets.com/3qi4Jf2SJGLR3j20wb5D)
- Tailwindcss - provides great way of styling using - utility-first styling that is seamlessly integrating into with Nextjs code.
- I plan to use Cypress for testing but I will explore Testing Library considering it is a go-to-library in the React Community.

## Improvements

- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress
- Creating a custom server as I improve my backend knowledge because I plan to make this portfolio full-stack app.
